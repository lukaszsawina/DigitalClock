## About The Project

My first c# project. The project presents a desktop version of the clock application for apple products.
</br>
Works average but it's my first c # project. While creating this project, I learned how to create WPF applications using Caliburn Micro to MVVM model.
I know about numerous bugs and code imperfections

</br>
This project is actually unfinished, the alarms are only visual and the app always resets when turned back on.
